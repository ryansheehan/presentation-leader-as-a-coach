<aside class="notes"><p>Once you see the effectiveness of the 4-conversations, it&#39;s hard to unsee the categorization of the conversations.  It&#39;s incredibly motivating to see the light bulbs trigger in others when they realize a conversation is missing.</p>

> _"Every meeting is an opportunity to categorize the messages I want to craft."_ -Me

<aside class="notes"><p>Its not uncommon to cover all 4 conversations within a single meeting.  I often find myself explicitly stating the category of the conversation I am having.  People intuitively get initiative, understanding, ask and promise, and closure conversations, even when they know nothing else.</p>

> _"Oh boy, how do I do hold myself accountable??"_ -Me

<aside class="notes"><p>I found this an interesting challenge, but not-really-a-challenge.  When I explicitly categorize the conversation I am holding, people understand my focus.  My hope is seeing the ideas of the 4-conversations spread, because I have already found it so effective at work.  Seeing the basic outline spread would be evidence of success.</p>

## Accountability Coaching Strategies

<!-- .slide: class="white" data-background="assets/lego.jpg" data-transition="slide" -->

<aside class="notes"><p>Snapping in the lego! This one is weird since it&#39;s about the coach.  Am I coaching myself, or coaching my boss and peers in coaching me!!  It&#39;s very meta.  My approach is to coach my boss and peers to coach me to gain more accountability.</p>

> _"The 4-conversations just make sense. Let's make sure we are having the right conversation with external teams."_ -Me to my peers.

<aside class="notes"><p>What has been great so far is that when I explained the 4 conversations, it really identified a roadmap for engaging teams outside our division.  It&#39;s identified gaps in our approach for implementing some large changes.  A lot of people are on board now.</p>

> _"This conversation is unproductive.  How can we ask the other team for a commitment if they don't understand the initiative."_ -Me to my team.

<aside class="notes"><p>This is a real quote.  We are trying to roll out some big company wide changes.  The default from engineering is to ask executive management to make the changes a decree.  I know it wont work if we take that approach.  They must understand the initiative, their place in the objective, then we can make the ask for a promise of delivery.  Shaping the environment here is removing the unproductive dialog.</p>

## Staying Accountable

| Who | How |
|---|---|
| Manager | Hold me accountable, and reflect on it in 1 on 1 meetings |
| Peers | Discuss conversation intent during meetings |
| Notes | Prepare conversation category notes prior to meetings |

<aside class="notes"><p>I&#39;ve already asked my boss to hold me accountable, and I have asked a couple peers to frame our cooperations with the 4 conversations in mind.  Taking notes about conversation topics is something I already do.  Marking them up will allow me to reflect after a meeting if the conversation took the expected direction based on how I marked them.</p>
